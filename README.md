## Why
In fact, many users urgently need a good tool that can help them improve their execution and help them manage their time. To this end, I decided to develop a drop-off list platform. This platform needs to have functions such as to-do record, calendar view, time reminder, etc., so that users can more conveniently and efficiently record to-do items at any time, and remind them at a set time, which can stimulate users to act immediately. The effect is to urge users to complete the established plan, improve the user's execution, and solve the user's pain points.
